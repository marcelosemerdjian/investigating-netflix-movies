# investigating-netflix-movies
This project is one of the projects I developed in DataCamp platform. It consists in a python notebook to check if movies are getting shorter trough the years.

The Analysis was made using the dataset: "netflix_data.csv". I used Pandas to explore the data and Matplotlib to plot the results.
